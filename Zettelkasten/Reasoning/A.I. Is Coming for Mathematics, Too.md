For more than 2,000 years, Euclid’s text was the paradigm of mathematical argumentation and reasoning. “Euclid famously starts with ‘definitions’ that are almost poetic,” Jeremy Avigad, a logician at Carnegie Mellon University, said in an email. “He then built the mathematics of the time on top of that, proving things in such a way that each successive step ‘clearly follows’ from previous ones, using the basic notions, definitions and prior theorems.” There were complaints that some of Euclid’s “obvious” steps were less than obvious, Avigad said, yet the system worked.

But by the 20th century, mathematicians were no longer willing to **ground mathematics in this intuitive geometric foundation**. Instead they developed formal systems — precise symbolic representations, mechanical rules. Eventually, this formalization allowed mathematics to be translated into computer code.

Now mathematicians are grappling with the latest transformative force: **artificial intelligence.**

Since attending the workshop, Emily Riehl, a mathematician at Johns Hopkins University, used an experimental proof-assistant program to formalize proofs she had previously published with a co-author. By the end of a verification, she said, **“I’m really, really deep into understanding the proof, way deeper than I’ve ever understood before. I’m thinking so clearly that I can explain it to a really dumb computer.”**

The article went on to ask whether solving problems with such tools truly counted as math. In Dr. Heule’s view, this approach is needed “to solve problems that are beyond what humans can do.”
