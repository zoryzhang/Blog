## Kernels
def. (**Real-valued Hilbert space**) a real textbftor space $\mathcal{H}$ equipped with an inner product, s.t. the induced normed textbftor space($|| \textbf v||=\sqrt{ \left<  \textbf v, \textbf v \right> }$) is a Banach space.

def. (**Kernel**) $k:\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a kernal if there exists a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$(feature space) and some map $\phi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{H}$ that satisfies $\forall x, x' \in \mathcal{X}, k(x, x')=\left< \phi(x), \phi(x') \right>_{\mathcal{H}}$.

thm. (**Mercer's condition**) let $\mathcal{X}$ be a compact set and $k:\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous and symmetric, then k admits a uniformly convergent expansion of the form $k(x, x')= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n} \phi_{n}(x) \phi_{n}(x')$ with $a_{n}>0$ iff $\forall c \in L_{2}(\mathcal{X}), \int \int_{\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X}} c(x)c(x')k(x,x') dxdx' \ge 0$.  
Proof. no yet


def. (**Positive definite symmetric kernel**, PDS) for any $S=\{x_{1}, \dots, x_{m}\} \subset \mathcal{X}$, the matrix $K=[k(x_i,x_j)]_{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ is symmetric positive semidefinite(SPSD).  
comment: 
- SPSD iff all eigenvalues non-negative iff $c^{T} K c \ge 0$ for any textbfter c.
- K is called the kernal matrix/Gram matrix associated to k and sample S.

e.g. (*Polynomial kernel*) a polynomial kernel of degree $d \in \mathbb{N}$ is defined by $\forall \textbf x, \textbf x' \in \mathbb{R}^{N},k(\textbf x, \textbf x') = ( \textbf{x} \cdot  \textbf{x}' + c)^d$.   
(exercise 6.12) The range is in space of dimension $N+d \choose d$ . 

e.g. (*Gaussian kernel*) a Gaussian kernel/radial basis function(RBF) is defined by $\forall \textbf x, \textbf x' \in \mathbb{R}^{N},k(\textbf x, \textbf x') = exp(-  \frac{||\textbf{x}'- \textbf{x}||^{2}}{ 2\sigma^{2}})$. The range is in space of infinite dimension.  
(section 6.2.3) Gaussian kernel can be derived by normalization from the kernel $k':( \textbf{x} ,  \textbf{x}') \mapsto exp( \frac{\textbf{x}\cdot\textbf{x}'}{\sigma^{2}})$, and can be further rewrote as $k'( \textbf{x} ,  \textbf{x}')=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} \frac{(\textbf{x} \cdot  \textbf{x}')^{n}}{\sigma^{2n}n!}$, a positive linear combinations of polynomial kernels of all degrees.

e.g. (*Sigmoid kernel*) for any real constant $a,b \ge 0$, a sigmoid kernel is defined by $\forall \textbf x, \textbf x' \in \mathbb{R}^{N},k(\textbf x, \textbf x') = \tanh( a  (\textbf{x} \cdot  \textbf{x}') + b)$.   
(exercise 6.18) if a<0 or b<0

## Reproducing kernel Hilbert space
lemma (**Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for PDS kernels**) let k be a PDS kernel. Then $\forall x,x' \in \mathcal{X}, k(x,x')^{2}  \le k(x,x) k(x',x')$.  
Proof. when k is PDS, then K:=the Gram matrix associated to k and sample x,x' is SPSD. Then $\det(K) \ge 0$.

def. (**Reproducing kernel Hilbert space**, RKHS) let $\mathcal{X}$ be a set and $\mathcal{H}$ a Hilbert space of real-valued functions on $\mathcal{X}$, equipped with pointwise addition and pointwise scalar multiplication. The evaluation functional over $\mathcal{H}$ is $L_{x}: f \mapsto f(x), f: \mathcal{H} \to \mathbb{R}$. Then $\mathcal{H}$ is a RKHS if, $\forall x \in \mathcal{X}, L_{x}$ is continuous at every $f \in \mathcal{H}$ or equivalently(1), $L_{x}$ is a bounded operator on H.   
Equivalently, given a kernel k, there exists a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ and a mapping $\phi$ by definition. Further more, $\mathcal{H}$ has the reproducing property:   
Equivalence(1): no yet  
Equivalence(2):

- The optimal values of most hyperparameters are sensitive to the batch size.

Therefore, changing the batch size typically requires starting the tuning

process all over again.

- The hyperparameters that interact most strongly with the batch size, and therefore are most important to tune separately for each batch size, are the optimizer hyperparameters (e.g. learning rate, momentum) and the regularization hyperparameters.

- Keep this in mind when choosing the batch size at the start of a project. If

you need to switch to a different batch size later on, it might be

difficult, time consuming, and expensive to re-tune everything for the new

batch size.

A reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) is a Hilbert space of functions that is defined by a positive definite kernel. One of the key properties of an RKHS is that the evaluation functional, $L_x$, defined by $L_x(f) = f(x)$, is a continuous linear functional on the space. The equivalence you mentioned states that the continuity of the evaluation functional at every point in the input space, $\mathcal{X}$, is equivalent to the evaluation functional being a bounded operator on the Hilbert space, $\mathcal{H}$.

The equivalence is true because a linear functional $L$ on a Hilbert space is continuous if and only if it is bounded. To see this, consider the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

$$ |L(f)|^2 \leq |L|^2 |f|^2 $$

This tells us that if $L$ is a continuous linear functional, then $|L(f)|$ is bounded by the product of the norm of $L$ and the norm of $f$. In other words, if $L$ is continuous, then $|L|$ is a finite non-negative number, which means $L$ is a bounded operator.

Conversely, if $L$ is a bounded operator, then the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality tells us that $|L(f)|$ is also bounded by a constant times $|f|$, so $L$ is continuous.

Thus, we see that continuity of the evaluation functional at every point in the input space is equivalent to the evaluation functional being a bounded operator on the Hilbert space.

It is also important to note that the key condition for $L_x$ being a bounded operator, is that the kernel is a positive definite function, as it gurantees the inner product of the space is well defined and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds.
